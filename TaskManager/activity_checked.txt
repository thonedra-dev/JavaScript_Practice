#### This is now in the development branch ###

One   : I have coded storage.js and state.js which are actually at the very end of the entire process. 
Two   : In storage.js, I have coded functions only about saving and loading tasks as, I want to test only to add a task and fetching it automatically.
Three : In taskService.js also, only cares about creating a task and saving it towards ==> state.js ==> storage.js to browser_storage.
Four  : So, my ui.js can access the tasks directly from state object as I am not aiming any filteration yet.
Five  : So, my index.html is only using the temporary div [  <div class="task-list-section"> ] for displaying the fetched tasks very straight-forwardly.
Six   : Yep, my app.js is also only having the adding task towards taskService.js only

! Need to modify app.js and ui.js alot add more on taskService.js for further development of the program.

### Master Branch ###

### Stage One ###

I need to define the filtering_task() in taskService.js which is checking manually from states.
Also, from ui.js, I need to fetch the data from that filtering_task() and fetch the rest piece of information.
Actually the thing is that, when we add something, app.js receives the id from the index.html and 
calls the function from taskSerivce very directly.
But, when we want to fetch something, such as searching, filtering based on [ status, priority ], yep, app.js 
still gets the id, but, update the state very immediately and calls the ui.render() which will call the function 
from filtering_task() again and that is how the program is being circled.
